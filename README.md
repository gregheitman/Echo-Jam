# Echo-Jam

###### Echo Jam is a set of tools to aid song writers.

Echo Jam offers four features that help song writers.
- [Rhyming & general help with finding words](#word-help)
- [Playing single chords](#chord)
- [Playing chord progressions](#chord-progression)

To start the Echo Jam skill, speak the words 

> Alexa Echo Jam

to Alexa.  At any time, you can ask for help by saying

> help

or ask for help for a specific feature by saying

> help metronome

or

> help chords

You can then ask for a feature below.

## Rhyming & General Help with Finding Words

Echo Jam allows Alexa to vocally list out words with certain criteria.
You may ask for 
> words that rhyme with \<blank>

or

> words that are related to \<blank>

You can also ask for two criterias in one sentence, such as

> give me words that sound like \<blank> and mean similar to \<blank>


<a name="chord" />
## Playing Single Chords

Echo Jam also gives Alexa musical abilities.  It allows a songwriter to ask Alexa for a specific chord.
> give me the d chord

or

> play an f minor chord


<a name="chord-progression" />
## Playing Chord Progressions

Chord progressions, which are sequences of chords played one after the other, are available too.

> play a chord progression in the key of c

Lastly, Echo Jam can play a metronome beat from very slow to very fast.
